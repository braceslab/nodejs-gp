### Run the Kart

As like as the workshop, connect via ssh to Raspberry and run webserver

````bash
ssh pi@192.168.1.194
password: raspberry (!your should have been changed!)
````

````bash
sudo -i
cd /home/pi/nodejs-gp
sudo node main.js
````

**open browser at 192.168.1.194**

If you'd like the complete solution with keyboard and touch support, just pull the ``complete`` branch :)

**Thank you for playing!**
